Recommendations to Reduce Customer Churn

Based on the analysis of categorical and numerical parameters, several factors influence churn, including contract type, tenure, monthly charges, payment method, internet service type, and family status. The following recommendations are designed to reduce churn and improve customer retention:

1. Contract & Tenure

   Issue: Month-to-month customers churn more, especially in the first 6 months.

   Recommendation:

   Offer discounts or loyalty rewards for customers who commit to 1- or 2-year contracts.

   Create welcome offers for new customers to keep them engaged during the risky early months.

2. Pricing & Monthly Charges

   Issue: High monthly charges correlate with churn.

   Recommendation:

    Introduce tiered pricing or bundled packages to reduce perceived cost.

    Offer personalized discounts to high-risk customers flagged by the churn model.

3. Payment Method

    Recommendation:

    Encourage auto-payment methods (credit card, bank transfer) with incentives like cashback or fee waivers.

    Simplify payment processes to reduce friction.

4. Internet Service Type

    Recommendation:

    Improve fiber service reliability and customer support.

    Offer service guarantees or proactive maintenance for fiber customers.

5. Family & Dependents

    Issue: Single customers churn more than those with family ties.

    Recommendation:

    Design family bundles or multi-line discounts to increase stickiness.

    Target single customers with engagement campaigns to build loyalty.

6. Customer Engagement

    Issue: New customers churn quickly if they don’t feel valued.

    Recommendation:

    Launch onboarding programs (tutorials, welcome calls, personalized offers).

    Provide proactive support in the first 90 days.

Conclusion
    By implementing these strategies, businesses can reduce churn significantly. The focus should be on incentivizing long-term contracts, offering personalized pricing, improving service quality, and enhancing customer engagement. These actions not only reduce churn but also strengthen customer loyalty and lifetime value.
